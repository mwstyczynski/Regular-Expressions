Regular Expressions
A regular expression (shortened as regex or regexp;[1] also referred to as rational expression[2][3]) is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern. Usually such patterns are used by string-searching algorithms for "find" or "find and replace" operations on strings, or for input validation. It is a technique developed in theoretical computer science and formal language theory.
